"""This project is implementing string methods. The subject is tallying the number of sales of a sewing shop, calculating the total amount of money made, and keeping track of the names of the customers.

In the begginning, the shop had an out-dating register system and stored all of the transaction information in one huge string called daily_sales.

For each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is all recorded in this same string. This program is iterating through this string and cleans up each transaction and stores all the information in easier to access lists."""

#This string is storing all the data and will be split up into individual pieces of data.
